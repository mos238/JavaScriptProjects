Below the robot object, reassign the _energyLevel property to 'high'.
To reassign a property, you can use dot notation to access the property and then use the = operator to assign it to another value. */

  /* Q2.
Now take a look at the new recharge method in robot. .recharge() will add 30 to _energyLevel. 
What will happen now that _energyLevel isnâ€™t a number?
Call .recharge() on robot to find out. */
