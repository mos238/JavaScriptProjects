Looping in Reverse
What if we want the for loop to log 3, 2, 1, and then 0? With simple modifications to the expressions, we can make our loop run backward!

To run a backward for loop, we must:

Set the iterator variable to the highest desired value in the initialization expression.
Set the stopping condition for when the iterator variable is less than the desired amount.
The iterator should decrease in intervals after each iteration. /*/





// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
    console.log(counter);
  }

  /*/Start your initialization variable in your initialization expression to the first number you want to print, 3.

Set the condition to check that the iterator variable remains greater than or equal to 0.

Change the iteration statement so the iterator variable decreases by increments of 1 after each round of the loop. 
To increase by 1, we can use the operator ++. To decrease by 1, we can use the operator --. /*/
