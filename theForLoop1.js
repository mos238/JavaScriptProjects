// Write your code below
/*/The for loop syntax looks like this:

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
} 
  
Letâ€™s break down the example:

The initialization is let counter = 0, so the loop will start counting at 0.
The stopping condition is counter < 4, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, counter, is less than 4.
The iteration statement is counter++. This means after each loop, the value of counter will increase by 1. For the first iteration counter will equal 0, for the second iteration counter will equal 1, and so on.
The code block is inside of the curly braces, console.log(counter), will execute until the condition evaluates to false.

for (let counter = 5; counter < 11; counter++){
    console.log(counter)
  }
